The "complete library"

Which might stomp p5/weather/sketch.js, so re-check it out.

I run a python httpd: ./httpd.

It wants:

	* pg/weather/`background.png`
	* make the folder p5/weather/cloud, and put your moving-dot-images in it: *.jpg
	* make the index.txt: `cd p5/weather/cloud; ls -1 *.jpg > index.txt`
